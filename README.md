# Pabbly Subscription Razorpay Integration for PHP
Sample App for Razorpay PHP Integration

This app uses a non composer integration, ideally you should use composer to integrate the Razorpay API.

# Steps for Integration:
Generally there are two methods available.
1.  Integration through checkout page.
2.  Integration through Pabbly Subscription  [api](https://www.pabbly.com/subscriptions/api/#section2)

If you want to use through checkout page, use the process-with-checkout-page.php and if you want to use through api, use process-with-api.php
